<h2>Inside code: &#x1F4C3;</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The Java program NumberGuessingGame initiates a number guessing game where the player has three attempts to guess a random number between 1 and 10.</li>
  <li>It utilizes the Scanner class for user input and generates a random number using the Math.random() method</li>
  <li>The player's guesses are compared to the random number, providing feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.</li>
  <li>After each round, the player is prompted to play again. If the player chooses to continue, another round begins; otherwise, the program terminates.</li>
</ol>
